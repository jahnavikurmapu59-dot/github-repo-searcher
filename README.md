GitHub Repository Searcher
This is a Spring Boot backend application that allows users to search GitHub repositories using the GitHub API, store the results in a database, and retrieve them later using REST endpoints. The application also supports filtering and ensures that duplicate repositories are not stored multiple times.
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate integration with an external API, database persistence using JPA, and clean RESTful design.
